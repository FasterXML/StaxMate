Version: 2.0.2

Release date:
  06-Sep-2012

Description:
  Another patch release for 2.0.0

Problems fixed:

* [STAXMATE-41] NPE with DOM elements/attributes when document built in non-NS mode
  (reported by Prokopis P)

Other:

* Now specifies dependency as Woodstox 4.1; although may still work on 4.0.x
 (just not tested or officially supported)

== History: ==
------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0.1: [20-Nov-2010]

NOTE: requires new version of stax2-api, 3.0.4 (at least for STAXMATE-37)

Problems fixed:

* [STAXMATE-37] getElemStringValue causes unexpected end_document when using
  default Sun Java6 XMLInputFactory (note: caused by Stax2 RI bug, outside of StaxMate)
 (reported by Rohan H)
* [STAXMATE-39] Problems with DomConverter, building DOM trees from Stax reader.
 (reported by Guillaume L)

2.0.0: [12-Mar-2009]

Compatibility changes:

* Requires Stax2-api 3.x (includes Typed Access API); new functionality
  used extensively by StaxMate.

Problems fixed:

New/improved functionality:

* [STAXMATE-7]: Added "SMInputCursor.asEvent()" to allow for
  accessing stream information in a more convenient form and retaining
  it if need be.
* [STAXMATE-8]: Added "DOMConverter", which allows building DOM trees
  from Stax stream reader, writing DOM trees into Stax stream writers
* [STAXMATE-10]: Typed accessor for Java Enum values (above and beyond
  basic Stax2 Typed Access API types)
* [STAXMATE-22]: Added "SMInputCursor.advance()" to support more
  convenient creation of positioned root cursors.
* [STAXMATE-25]: Allow pre-declaring namespaces with
  "SMOutputElement.predeclareNamespace"
  (requested by Gregg H)
* [STAXMATE-28]: StaxMate jar is now a valid OSGi bundle, with complete
  import/export statements.
* Most basic Typed Access API types support for both cursors and
  output elements.

1.3.1: [06-Dec-2008]

Problems fixed:

* [STAXMATE-26]: NPE when passing null namespace to SMOutputContainer.createBufferedElement()
* [STAXMATE-27]: Attributes were not retained for buffered elements.

1.3.0: [03-Sep-2008]

Problems fixed:

* [STAXMATE-20]: Binding of non-default namespaces was buggy; scoping
    was not properly handled, leading to missing declarations
* Vastly improved Javadocs.
* Added more Typed Access methods to input cursors (only had int
    accessors for attributes)

New/improved functionality:

* [STAXMATE-12]: Upgrade sample web app to use later jars (woodstox,
  jetty, staxmate)
* [STAXMATE-13]: StaxMate factories can now be constructed as "stateful",
  meaning they can contain reference to underlying Stax stream factory
  to use. This can simplify code for constructing StaxMate objects.
* [STAXMATE-15]: Added Typed Access methods to writer side (write
  boolean/int/long attributes, character content).
* [STAXMATE-19]: Add convenience method for accessing current stream
  location (SMInputCursor.getStreamLocation()). Also added matching
  'SMInputCursor.getCursorLocation()', and deprecated older ambiguously
  name 'SMInputCursor.getLocation()'.
* Added 'SMInputCursor.getPathDesc()' which will produce XPath-like
  description of where the cursor points to, if element tracking has
  been enabled (so that information is available)

1.2.0: [01-Aug-2008]

Problems fixed:
  * [STAXMATE-6]: Verify that StaxMate works well on Sun Sjsxp (default
    Stax impl of JDK 6). One fix to Stax2 ref. impl (from Woodstox);
    one workaround to Sjsxp bug (#63).
  * [STAXMATE-11]: Verify that StaxMate works well on Aalto XML processor

1.1.0: [13-Nov-2007]

New functionality:
  * [STAXMATE-3]: Added SMInputCursor.hasName() methods.

Improvements:

  * [STAXMATE-4]: Rewrite cursor synchronization (sub-tree skipping) using
    depth information given by underlying Stax2 stream reader, instead of
    each cursor keeping local nesting counts.

1.0.0: [02-May-2007]

  Problems fixed:

  * [STAXMATE-1]: Cursor synchronization did not work as expected 
    when reading text nodes.
  * Handling of sub-tree skipping when START_ELEMENT were filtered out
    was not working correctly (either with hierarchic or flat cursors)

  New functionality:

  * Added ElementFilter, for only accessing elements with specified
    name

0.9.1: [12-Sep-2006]

  Problems fixed:

  * Nested cursor synchronization problems fixed, unit tests added
    [contributed by Ed G, David B]

0.9: [11-Aug-2006]

  New functionality:

  * Full writer-side functionality included

  Rewrite:

  * Converted StaxMate to JDK 1.5: now uses Enums as return values, which
    is nice as Enums can have properties.
  * Renamed 'iterators' to 'cursors' (input side change); renamed packages
    to have more meaningful names.

....

0.6: [late 2004]

  Added writer-side functionality

0.5: [mid-2004]:

  First version, proof-of-concept, only reader side functionality.
